# One line of Wordle
## How to run
To run, clone the repo and run `python3 wordle.py` (Python 3.8+ required)

Alternatively, you can run it online [here](https://replit.com/@Stegg2020/1LineWordle#main.py)

## File Info
This repo contains 3 python files, all of which contain the exact same code

`wordle.py` contains one line of python

`wordle_source.py` contains a better formated version of `wordle.py`

`wordle_annotated.py` contains comments that explain the process behind each bit of code

## Challenge Info
If you'd like to know the rules I set for myself, it's:
 1. All code must be on one line
 2. Semicolons, lambdas, and evals aren't allowed
 3. Only imports from Python's standard library is allowed
 4. Any version of Python 3 can be used, but latest is preferable
